3.3 Test Case Template Example

Test Case ID: TC-SYS-001
Title: Verify Speed Limit Warning Activation
Related Requirement: SYS-REQ-015

- GPS signal available

Test Steps:
1. Set vehicle speed to 45 km/h
2. Enter zone with 50 km/h speed limit

Pass/Fail Criteria:
- PASS: Warning activates within 500ms and deactivates correctly
- FAIL: Warning does not activate, activates late, or persists incorrectly

4. TEST TYPES IN ASPICE

4.1 Functional Testing
Verifies system performs required functions:
- Input/output validation
- Calculation accuracy
- State transitions
- Interface behavior

4.2 Non-Functional Testing
Verifies quality attributes:
- Performance: Response time, throughput
- Reliability: Stability over time
- Resource Usage: Memory, CPU utilization
- Boundary Conditions: Min/max values

4.3 Regression Testing
Ensures existing functionality not broken:
- Re-execution of previous test cases
- Automated regression suites
- Impact analysis of changes

4.4 Safety Testing
Specific to ISO 26262 compliance:
- Fault injection testing
- Error handling verification
- Safety mechanism validation
- Failure mode testing

5. TEST COVERAGE

5.1 Requirements Coverage
- Every requirement has at least one test case
- Critical requirements have multiple test cases
- Traceability matrix maintained

5.2 Code Coverage (for software)
- Statement coverage
- Branch coverage
- Modified Condition/Decision Coverage (MC/DC) for safety-critical

5.3 Interface Coverage
- All system interfaces tested
- All communication protocols verified
- Boundary conditions of interfaces tested

6. TEST EXECUTION AND REPORTING

6.1 Test Execution
- Follow test procedures precisely
- Document actual results
- Record any deviations or anomalies
- Log test environment details

6.2 Test Reporting
Test reports should include:
- Test summary (passed/failed/blocked)
- Test coverage metrics
- Defect summary
- Recommendations

7. VERIFICATION AND VALIDATION

7.1 Verification
"Are we building the product right?"
- Requirements verification
- Design verification
- Code verification
- Integration verification

7.2 Validation
"Are we building the right product?"
- System-level testing
- User acceptance testing
- Field testing
- Stakeholder validation

8. ASPICE TEST CASE EXAMPLES

8.1 ECU Functional Test Cases

TC-ECU-001: Power-Up Sequence Verification
Objective: Verify ECU initializes correctly on power-up
Steps:
1. Apply 12V power to ECU
2. Monitor initialization sequence via diagnostic interface
3. Verify all self-tests complete successfully
4. Check ECU transitions to operational state within 2 seconds
Expected: All self-tests pass, no DTCs logged, operational within timeout
Pass/Fail: PASS if initialization completes without errors

TC-ECU-002: CAN Communication Test
Objective: Verify ECU sends and receives CAN messages correctly
Steps:
1. Connect ECU to CAN bus with test bench
2. Send test message to ECU (ID 0x100, data: 0x01020304)
3. Verify ECU processes message
4. Monitor outgoing messages from ECU
5. Verify periodic message transmission (e.g., status message every 100ms)
Expected: ECU receives and responds correctly, periodic messages within timing
Pass/Fail: PASS if all messages received/sent with correct timing and data

8.2 System Integration Test Cases

TC-SYS-INT-001: Sensor-ECU-Actuator Chain
Objective: Verify complete signal path from sensor to actuator
Steps:
1. Stimulate speed sensor with known signal (50 km/h)
2. Verify ECU receives and interprets sensor data correctly
3. Verify ECU calculates and sends actuator command
4. Verify actuator responds to command within 50ms
5. Measure end-to-end latency
Expected: Complete chain operates within 100ms total latency
Pass/Fail: PASS if latency < 100ms and all values correct

8.3 Safety Test Cases

TC-SAFETY-001: Sensor Fault Detection
Objective: Verify system detects and handles sensor faults (ASIL C)
Steps:
1. Operate system under normal conditions
2. Inject sensor fault (disconnect sensor signal)
3. Verify system detects fault within 50ms
4. Verify system transitions to safe state
5. Verify driver warning activated
6. Verify DTC logged correctly

9. TEST AUTOMATION

9.1 Automated Test Execution
Benefits:
- Repeatable and consistent
- Faster execution
- Better regression coverage
- Reduced human error

9.2 Test Automation Tools
- HIL (Hardware-in-the-Loop) systems
- Test management systems (DOORS, JIRA, TestRail)
- Test execution frameworks (CANoe, Vector tools)
- Continuous integration systems

10. TRACEABILITY IN TESTING

Bidirectional traceability ensures:
- Requirements → Test Cases (forward)
- Test Cases → Requirements (backward)
- Test Results → Requirements (verification status)

Traceability Matrix Example:
| Req ID      | Test Case ID | Status   | Result |
|-------------|-------------|----------|--------|
| SYS-REQ-001 | TC-SYS-001  | Executed | PASS   |
| SYS-REQ-002 | TC-SYS-002  | Executed | PASS   |
| SYS-REQ-003 | TC-SYS-003  | Blocked  | N/A    |

11. BEST PRACTICES FOR TEST CASE DEVELOPMENT

- Write clear, unambiguous test steps
- Use consistent terminology and format
- Include setup and teardown procedures
- Specify exact expected results (not "system works")
- Define objective pass/fail criteria (measurable)
- Keep test cases atomic (one objective per test)
- Maintain test case version control
- Review test cases with stakeholders
- Update test cases when requirements change
- Prioritize test cases by risk and criticality

12. COMMON PITFALLS

- Vague expected results ("system responds appropriately")
- Missing prerequisites and setup steps
- Insufficient test data specification
- Lack of traceability to requirements
- No clear pass/fail criteria
- Testing multiple requirements in one test case
- Ignoring negative test scenarios
- Inadequate error handling tests
