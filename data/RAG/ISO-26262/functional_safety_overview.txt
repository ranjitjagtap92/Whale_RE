ISO 26262 - Functional Safety for Road Vehicles

1. OVERVIEW

ISO 26262 is the international standard for functional safety of electrical and electronic systems in production automobiles. It addresses possible hazards caused by malfunctioning behavior of safety-related E/E systems.

2. ASIL - AUTOMOTIVE SAFETY INTEGRITY LEVEL

ASIL represents the level of risk associated with a hazard. Four ASIL levels exist:
- ASIL D: Highest integrity requirements (e.g., airbag control, brake-by-wire)
- ASIL C: High integrity requirements (e.g., ABS, ESC)
- ASIL B: Medium integrity requirements (e.g., brake lights)
- ASIL A: Lowest integrity requirements (e.g., rear windshield wiper)
- QM (Quality Management): No safety requirements

ASIL determination considers:
- Severity (S): Potential harm from hazard (S0-S3)
- Exposure (E): Probability of operational situation (E0-E4)
- Controllability (C): Ability to avoid harm (C0-C3)

4.1 Safety Goals
High-level safety requirements derived from HARA:
- "The vehicle shall prevent unintended acceleration" (ASIL D)
- "The system shall detect and mitigate brake failures" (ASIL D)
- "The vehicle shall maintain stability during emergency maneuvers" (ASIL C)

4.2 Functional Safety Requirements (FSR)
Derived from safety goals to describe safe behavior:
- Detection requirements: "The system shall detect sensor faults within 100ms"
- Mitigation requirements: "The system shall transition to safe state upon critical failure"
- Warning requirements: "The system shall alert the driver of degraded functionality"

4.3 Technical Safety Requirements (TSR)
Implementation-level requirements:
- Hardware safety requirements
- Software safety requirements
- Interface requirements between components

5. SAFETY MECHANISMS

Common safety mechanisms include:
- Redundancy: Dual-channel systems with voting
- Monitoring: Plausibility checks, range checks, temporal checks
- Error Detection: CRC, parity, watchdog timers
- Fault Tolerance: Graceful degradation, safe states
- Diagnostic Coverage: Self-test routines, BIST

6. VERIFICATION AND VALIDATION

6.1 Verification Methods
- Requirements review
- Design review
- Code inspection
- Static analysis
- Unit testing
- Integration testing
- System testing

6.2 Validation Activities
- Fault injection testing
- Hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) testing
- Vehicle-level testing
- Field testing

7. SAFETY CASE DOCUMENTATION

Safety case demonstrates compliance:
- Safety Plan
- Safety Requirements Specification
- Safety Analysis Reports
- Verification and Validation Reports
- Safety Assessment Report

8. AUTOMOTIVE SAFETY REQUIREMENTS EXAMPLES

8.1 Powertrain Safety
- "The engine control system shall limit torque output to prevent wheel slip" (ASIL C)
- "The fuel system shall shut off fuel supply in case of collision detection" (ASIL D)
- "The transmission shall prevent unintended gear shifts" (ASIL C)

8.2 Chassis Safety
- "The brake system shall maintain stopping capability with single-point failures" (ASIL D)
- "The steering system shall provide mechanical fallback in case of electrical failure" (ASIL D)
- "The suspension system shall detect and report damper failures" (ASIL B)

8.3 ADAS Safety
- "The adaptive cruise control shall maintain safe following distance" (ASIL B)
- "The lane keeping assist shall not cause unintended steering inputs" (ASIL C)
- "The emergency braking system shall activate within 200ms of obstacle detection" (ASIL D)

9. SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS

9.1 Software Safety Requirements
- "Software shall perform input validation on all sensor data"
- "Software shall implement memory protection mechanisms"
- "Software shall use defensive programming practices"
- "Software shall include runtime error detection"

9.2 Software Architecture
- Modular design with clear interfaces
- Separation of safety-critical and non-critical functions
- Freedom from interference between software components
- Deterministic execution behavior

10. HARDWARE REQUIREMENTS

10.1 Hardware Safety Requirements
- "Hardware shall implement ECC for memory protection"
- "Hardware shall include independent safety processors for monitoring"
- "Hardware shall detect voltage and temperature anomalies"
- "Hardware shall meet random hardware failure metrics (PMHF targets)"

10.2 Hardware Metrics
- Single Point Fault Metric (SPFM)
- Latent Fault Metric (LFM)
- Probabilistic Metric for Hardware Failures (PMHF)

11. SYSTEM INTEGRATION

Integration requirements:
- "Safety-critical systems shall communicate via redundant channels"
- "System shall implement temporal and spatial partitioning"
- "System shall prevent cascade failures across components"
- "System shall coordinate safety mechanisms across ECUs"

12. REQUIREMENT ATTRIBUTES FOR FUNCTIONAL SAFETY

Each requirement should specify:
- ASIL level
- Safety mechanism allocation
- Verification method (test, analysis, inspection)
- Dependent requirements
- Failure modes addressed
- Diagnostic coverage target

13. DECOMPOSITION

ASIL decomposition allows distributing safety requirements:
- ASIL D can decompose to ASIL C + ASIL C (with independence)
- ASIL D can decompose to ASIL D + QM (with one sufficient safety element)
- Decomposition requires justification and independence demonstration

14. SAFETY PATTERNS

Common safety patterns:
- Dual-Core Lockstep: Two cores execute same code, compare results
- Diverse Redundancy: Different implementations of same function
- Watchdog Monitoring: External monitor checks system health
- Safe State: Defined system state when faults detected
- Limp-Home Mode: Degraded but safe operation mode
