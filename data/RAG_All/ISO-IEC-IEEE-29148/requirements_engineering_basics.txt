ISO/IEC/IEEE 29148 - Requirements Engineering Standard

1. INTRODUCTION TO REQUIREMENTS ENGINEERING

Requirements engineering is the systematic approach to eliciting, documenting, validating, and managing requirements throughout the system lifecycle. This standard provides guidelines for best practices in requirements engineering processes.

2. REQUIREMENT CHARACTERISTICS

Good requirements should possess the following characteristics:
- Clear and unambiguous: Each requirement shall have only one interpretation
- Complete: The requirement describes the necessary functionality in full
- Consistent: Requirements shall not contradict each other
- Verifiable: It must be possible to verify that the requirement has been met
- Traceable: Requirements shall be traced to source documents and design elements
- Feasible: Requirements must be achievable within known constraints
- Necessary: Each requirement shall address a stakeholder need

3. REQUIREMENT TYPES

3.1 Functional Requirements
Functional requirements define what the system must do. They describe system behavior, inputs, outputs, and operations. Examples include:
- "The system shall process user login requests within 2 seconds"
- "The system shall validate input data against predefined rules"
- "The system shall generate monthly reports in PDF format"

3.2 Non-Functional Requirements
Non-functional requirements specify system qualities and constraints:
- Performance: Response time, throughput, resource usage
- Reliability: Availability, mean time between failures
- Safety: Hazard mitigation, fail-safe mechanisms
- Security: Authentication, authorization, encryption
- Usability: User interface design, accessibility
- Maintainability: Code quality, documentation

3.3 Interface Requirements
Interface requirements define how the system interacts with external entities:
- User interfaces
- Hardware interfaces
- Software interfaces
- Communication protocols

4. REQUIREMENT DOCUMENTATION

4.1 Requirement Statements
Each requirement statement shall follow a standard format:
- Unique Identifier: REQ-XXX-NNN
- Title: Brief descriptive name
- Description: Complete requirement statement using "shall" for mandatory requirements
- Rationale: Justification for the requirement
- Priority: Critical, High, Medium, Low
- Verification Method: Inspection, Analysis, Test, Demonstration

4.2 Requirement Attributes
Requirements should include metadata attributes:
- Source: Originating stakeholder or document
- Status: Proposed, Approved, Implemented, Verified
- Owner: Responsible party
- Dependencies: Related requirements
- Acceptance Criteria: Conditions for requirement satisfaction

5. REQUIREMENTS QUALITY ASSURANCE

5.1 Requirements Review
Requirements shall be reviewed for:
- Correctness: Accurately reflects stakeholder needs
- Completeness: No missing information
- Consistency: No conflicts with other requirements
- Clarity: Unambiguous and understandable
- Testability: Can be verified through testing

5.2 Requirements Validation
Validation ensures requirements meet stakeholder needs:
- Stakeholder review sessions
- Prototyping and simulation
- Requirements walkthroughs
- Formal inspections

6. REQUIREMENTS TRACEABILITY

Traceability links requirements throughout the lifecycle:
- Forward traceability: Requirements to design and test cases
- Backward traceability: Requirements to source documents
- Bidirectional traceability: Complete traceability chain

Traceability Matrix should document:
- Source requirement ID
- Derived requirement ID
- Design element ID
- Test case ID
- Verification status

7. REQUIREMENTS CHANGE MANAGEMENT

Change management ensures controlled requirement evolution:
- Change request process
- Impact analysis
- Change approval workflow
- Version control
- Notification to affected parties

8. BEST PRACTICES

- Use consistent terminology and templates
- Avoid ambiguous words (e.g., "user-friendly", "fast", "reliable")
- Use active voice and imperative mood
- Express requirements quantitatively when possible
- Separate concerns (one requirement per statement)
- Prioritize requirements based on stakeholder value
- Maintain requirement traceability throughout lifecycle
- Review requirements regularly with stakeholders

9. COMMON PITFALLS TO AVOID

- Combining multiple requirements in one statement
- Using vague or subjective language
- Including implementation details in requirements
- Omitting acceptance criteria
- Neglecting non-functional requirements
- Poor requirement organization and structure
- Insufficient stakeholder involvement

10. AUTOMOTIVE-SPECIFIC CONSIDERATIONS

For automotive systems, requirements must address:
- Functional safety (ISO 26262)
- Security (ISO 21434)
- Real-time constraints
- Environmental conditions (temperature, vibration, EMI)
- Regulatory compliance (ECE regulations)
- Lifecycle support and maintenance

Requirements should be allocated to appropriate ASIL levels and include:
- Safety goals
- Functional safety requirements
- Technical safety requirements
- Hardware/software safety requirements
